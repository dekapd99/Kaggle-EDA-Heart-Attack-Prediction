# Heart Attack Prediction

Kaggle Data Predictions Regarding Heart Attacks
## 1.2 Recognizing Variable in Dataset

#### **Variable definitions in the Dataset**

* **Age**: Age of the patient
* **Sex**: Sex of the patient
* **exang**: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
* **ca**: number of major vessels (0-3)
* **cp**: Chest Pain type chest pain type
  * *Value 1*: typical angina
  * *Value 2*: atypical angina
  * *Value 3*: non-anginal pain
  * *Value 4*: asymptomatic
* **trtbps**: resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)
* **chol**: cholestoral in mg/dl fetched via BMI sensor
* **fbs**: (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)
* **rest_ecg**: resting electrocardiographic results
  * *Value 0*: normal
  * *Value 1*: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)
  * *Value 2*: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria
* **thalach**: maximum heart rate achieved
* **target**: 0= less chance of heart attack 1= more chance of heart attack

#### **Additional variable descriptions**

* ***age*** - age in years
* ***sex*** - sex (1 = male; 0 = female)
* ***cp*** - chest pain type (1 = typical angina; 2 = atypical angina; 3 = non-anginal pain; 0 = asymptomatic)
* ***trestbps*** - resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
* ***chol*** - serum cholestoral in mg/dl
* ***fbs*** - fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)
* ***rest_ecg*** - resting electrocardiographic results (1 = normal; 2 = having ST-T wave abnormality; 0 = hypertrophy)
* ***thalach*** - maximum heart rate achieved
* ***exang*** - exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
* ***oldpeak*** - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
* ***slope*** - the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (2 = upsloping; 1 = flat; 0 = downsloping)
* ***ca*** - number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
* ***thal*** - 2 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 3 = reversable defect
* ***num*** - the predicted attribute - diagnosis of heart disease (angiographic disease status) (Value 0 = < diameter narrowing; Value 1 = > 50% diameter narrowing)
